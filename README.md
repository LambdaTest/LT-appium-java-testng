# How to run Parallel Tests in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=appium-java-testNG-parallelTest) using Appium in the Java TestNG Framework

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid,
you might face a scenario where you want to run your test on multiple devices to see the edge cases. 
If you choose to run them on a single device, it get's time consuming. 
Alternatively, you can run your tests in Parallel which means that your tests will run on multiple devices simultaneously!
This makes sure that you're using the time of running one test to run multiple.

# Steps:

You can make this change in the ```Android.xml``` and ```iOS.xml```:

Below is the ```Android.xml``` example shown, feel free to add more Devices based on your plan.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite thread-count="100" name="Mobile" parallel="tests">


    <test name="AndroidAppTest 1">
        <parameter name="version" value="10"/>
        <parameter name="platform" value="Android"/>
        <parameter name="device" value="Pixel 3 XL"/>
        <classes>
            <class name="AndroidApp"/>
        </classes>
    </test>

    <test name="AndroidAppTest 2">
        <parameter name="version" value="10"/>
        <parameter name="platform" value="Android"/>
        <parameter name="device" value="Pixel 4"/>
        <classes>
            <class name="AndroidApp"/>
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>
```

### **Step 3: Execute Your Test Case**
Debug and run your code. Run iOSApp.java or AndroidApp.java in your editor.
```
mvn clean install -DsuiteXmlFile=src/test/java/Android.xml
```
```
mvn clean install -DsuiteXmlFile=src/test/java/IOS.xml
```

Info: Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the üîó LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard.



Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
